# Pose Estimation Project

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to perform pose estimation on video files.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the prerequisites using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the prerequisites
3. Prepare the video file you want to use for testing
4. Replace the video file path in `pose_estimate.py` with the path to your video file

## Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language used.
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) - Used for image processing.
* [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) - Used for pose estimation.
